        <figcaption>India finished 48th on the medal tally in Tokyo, its highest India was expected to deliver its best-ever Olympics medals haul in Paris 2024. It ended with six medals, one less than its best ever showing at Tokyo 2020. In Paris, India also had six fourth-place finishes, and a disqualification that turned a medal into a no-show, leading to narratives of what might have been. What will it take to deliver more Olympic medals? The answer is a lot, at many levels. From deepening and widening of the playing of sports at the grassroots level, to strengthening the transition to playing at competitive levels, to sharpening the support for pursuit of medals at the very top.
            India’s quest for more Olympic medals has been centered at the top, via the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS). This central government-funded scheme identifies medal prospects and extends financial support for their training and competition during the Games cycle. Some sports have benefitted. Take shooting. Under TOPS, in the Paris Olympics cycle, the government reportedly spent ₹60 crore to support 28 shooters. In Tokyo 2020, India’s 20 participations returned an average placing of 19. In Paris, the 28 participations averaged a placing of 13, including 3 medals. The targeting of elite athletes was a key lever Great Britain pulled to reclaim its status as a leading Olympic nation. After winning just 15 medals at Atlanta 1996, it set up UK Sport in 1997. Funded by the National Lottery and the government, it invests money in Olympic and Paralympic sports, aimed at building a high-performance culture with an implicit pathway to Olympic medals.
            Any successful sport reolves around a self-perpetuating cycle of widespread adoption, globally competitive events, commercial outlets, fan interest and on-field success. In India, cricket has created that cycle. Badminton has made strides in the past two decades. Beyond them, most sports are struggling to craft that foundational circle. The sports bodies tasked with that are often corrupt or are plagued by deficits in finances, governance, and imagination. Sports Authority of India has registered an average income increase of just 9% between 2014-15 and 2021-22, the latest period for which its data is available. For the ministry of sports, SAI’s biggest funder, that increase is 10.5%. Federations remain weak and are bastions of politicians. While they receive government funding, in the context of promoting the sport at the grassroots, holding competitive events and nurturing talent, their budgets are puny.
